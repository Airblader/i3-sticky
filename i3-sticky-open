"""
Opens a placeholder window for a sticky group.

This utility opens a mostly empty window to be used as a placeholder container
with i3-sticky. It takes an optional argument describing the group for which
the container should be, defaulting to '1'. i3-sticky will pick up on this
window and automatically mark it as a placeholder container for the
corresponding group.
